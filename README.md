This repository demonstrates a common error when using the Firebase SDK: attempting to access data from a document snapshot before the promise returned by `getDoc()` or similar methods has resolved.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version using `.then()` to handle the promise properly.  This issue often leads to unexpected behavior or errors because the snapshot's properties will be undefined until the data is fully loaded from the Firebase server.
